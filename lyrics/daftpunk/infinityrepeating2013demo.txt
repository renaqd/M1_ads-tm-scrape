"Infinity Repeating (2013 Demo)"

I was crossing the border
Two old friend coincidence
I don't want any other
Two old friend coincidences

Weekday
Weekday
Weekday

I don't wanna play any other game
On a simpler day

It's not right
It's not true
It's not right
It's not how we used to do

It's not true
It's not right
It's not how we used to do

It's not true
It's not right
It's not how we used to do

What he does, he does well
He does well, what he does
He knows it
Lay down
Just lay down

I was crossing the border
We were waiting in line
I don't want any other
Two old friend coincidences

Forks inside my head
Dinner's at mine or yours

Weekday
Weekday
Weekday

I don't wanna say what he wants to know
On a simpler day
