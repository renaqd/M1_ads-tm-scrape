"Doin' It Right"

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll be feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight
[x6]

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
[x2]

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll be feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight...

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
[x2]

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right
[x2]

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
[x4]

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right
