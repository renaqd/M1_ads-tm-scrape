"Face To Face"

What's going on? Could this be my understanding?
It's not your fault I was being too demanding
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different

There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

I turned away 'cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face
