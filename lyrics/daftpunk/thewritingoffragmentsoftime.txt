"The Writing Of Fragments Of Time"

Keep building those (keep building those, yeah)
Random memor-
I would never leave
Keep building those random memories (so)
(So you know this song is about Todd coming here, and)
(And, and making the song, and, and uh, working with us)

(I would never leave)
(Keep building these random memories)
Ha ha, good, we're almost there with this part!
I knew the beginning was the hardest part, it was like working like-

I would never leave
Keep building these random memories, oh

'Cause wait, that-, this is the thing
"Since I can't", it's gonna be like, "But since-"
Something about it, having to stop
The way I'll get around that is by going back to these, yes
("I'll keep playing back these fragments of time")
Yeah, exactly, these fragments, that's how it's gonna be

(These fragments)
(These fragments of time)

(I just keep playing back)
(These fragments of time) Fragments of time
(Fragments of time)
Wait, do me a favor, I don't mean to cut you, because we're-, I'm almost
I just wanna hear the-, before the "way, I would never-"

Way

I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Before it's too late
Okay, so that's the part, I have to just remember that
I mean

Okay, alright, so, um
So the thing of it is "I can't-", "I can't stay"
But it's like, the whole concept is "I can't stay"
(But things-, it comes to an end)
(But since everything comes, you know-) Yeah, yeah, "but since everything come-"
(Since everything) Oh wait, hold on, yeah

(I don't know if it's you that "can't stay") I know, but-

And I don't ever want it to end
(If I had my way, I would never leave)
(Keep building these random memories)
(Since I can't stay)
(I'll just keep playing back)
That's good, that's good, yeah
(These fragments of time)

You think the line should- um, like, I think this will be a good thing
Should the line reflect that it can't stay the same?
Like, in other words, I wish that it could always remain today, like, type of thing?
Like, should it be that?
That might help in writing it, like, in other words, you know

(Keep building these random memories)
(Turning your days into melodies) That's so sweet, that this is-
(But since I can't stay) "Turning your days into melodies", wait, okay
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay (woohoo!)

(If I had my way, I would never leave)
(Keep building these random memories)
(Turning our days into melodies)
But since I can't stay

(I think that sometimes the hard thing is just finding the melody)
(And now we have the melody for the second part of the verse) Yeah, yeah, exactly
(Which can just like, write another thing) Yeah, exactly, yeah, exactly! For the second-
(If we do that, it just becomes two verse) Yeah, exactly
(Or if we-, if we-)
(Or, if we really struggle, it can just become our second verse, you know) Exactly
(It's more like a backup plan, y'know?) Exactly, yeah-, yeah, exactly
And plus, the idea is that you can even, you know, for the second verse
Kinda sing it like this, but change some of it, like, you know, improvise like-
"If I can't-", you know, it's like-, you know, like)
(But if there's no way, or, you know, I'll just keep playing that)
Yeah, yeah, like-, exactly, yeah (I'll find a way, uh, you know)

Whatever the case, we'll find a breakthrough (Yeah, but if not-)
(I agree, I agree, let's imagine that we do)

There's so many di-, so many possibilities, uh, like, for it to be rhymed very easily, um
Faces I've never seen (Fantasy? We're doing that to another song)
I didn't say "fantasy", I said, I said, uh (Oh, you didn't say-)
Faces that I've seen in dre- (Oh, sorry)
Seen and dreamed, like, in other words, like

(Oh) You know, it's like, I don't know-
("Familiar faces I've never seen") Yeah, familiar faces I've never seen
(Instead of doing "unfamiliar faces" that seems like, it's still "familiar faces I've never seen", you know?)
I love it, that's so crazy
Familiar faces I've never seen (that's good, right?)
"In memories, I found my dream", or like-
(Familiar faces I've never seen)
Oh my God, that's such a beautiful line, "familiar faces I've never seen". I love it!

(Familiar faces I've never seen)
(Turning this straight out of a dream)
Like, you know, a half-remembered dream, or something like-
(There's something like that in "Touch", he said that) Oh, really?
(Yeah) That's crazy, I did not-, I didn't pick that up, that's like-
(A half-remembered song, yeah) Wow, that's crazy
No, I know, but I swear, I didn't-, but like that just came up-
No, but the connection is just like, it's crazy
(That "seen and dream", that's cool, it's cool too) Yeah, yeah, ye-
(Dream, been) Yeah, yeah
(A dream within a dream, it's in "Touch" too) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(There's the word "dream" everywhere) Yeah, so which is fine
And it kinda of has a connection to it, like the congruency, yeah

That "familiar faces" line, man, that's-, that's hot
To be able to express something so great, and, like
It's almost like a haiku, because it's like-, you know what I mean?
You only have a few syllables to say something and it's like-
(But that's totally the-, my alley of like the, California vibes, you know?) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Familiar faces I've never seen
You know, I didn't say-, I'm actually, it's-
There's some parts I'm getting choked up 'cause it's so damn emotional, just putting these 3 weeks into words, it's really intense, actually
I've never felt anything like this before (Now every time you hear this song, it's gonna-)
Yeah, seriously, it's insane, yeah (it's capturing it, it's making it forever)
