"Beyond"

Dream,
Beyond dreams
Beyond life you will find your song
Before sound, to be found close your eyes
And rise higher, still endless thrill
To the land of love
Beyond love
Come alive,
Angel eye
Forever watching you and I

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed

There's no such thing as competition
To find our way we lose control
Remember â€“ love's our only mission
This is the journey of the soul

The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams
