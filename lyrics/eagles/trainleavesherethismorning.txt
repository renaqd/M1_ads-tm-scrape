"Train Leaves Here This Morning"

I lost ten points just for being
In the right place at exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there,
But I may as well have been completely blind

So, if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home

There's a train leaves here this morning,
I don't know what I might be on

She signed me to a contract,
Baby said it would all be so life-long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on

But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on

There's a train leaves here this morning
I don't know, what I might be on

1320 North Columbus was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was getting time to leave

And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on."

'Cause there's a train leaves here this morning
I don't know what I might be on

There's a train leaves here this morning
I don't know what I might be on
