"Tryin'"

I'm just arriving in the city
And there's music on my mind
Lookin' for my destination
And my home is far behind

'Cause it's a long road ahead
And you can make it in the end
I'm gonna make it with my friends
And I'm tryin'

It took me sometime to see it
Now I'm looking through this world
And it's gonna take some time
Before I get back, help me, girl

'Cause you can make it if you try
You gotta lay it on the line
And everything will be fine
If you try

Sittin' smokin' just a-thinkin'
Is an easy thing to do
We gotta keep on trying
For the feelin' to come through

And it's a lonely way to live
You gotta take it, you gotta give
If you mistake it, just try again
And I'm trying,

Ah, we got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Whoa, I'm trying
We got to keep on trying
Whoa, I'm trying
We got to keep on trying
We got to keep on trying
