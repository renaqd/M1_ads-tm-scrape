"Sunset Grill"

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And stare out at the auburn sky

There's an old man there from the old world
To him, its all the same
Calls all his customers by name

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

You see a lot more meanness in the city
Its the kind that tears you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Don't worry girl, I'm gonna stick by you
And someday soon were gonna get in that car and get outta here

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And gaze out at the auburn sky

Maybe well leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
