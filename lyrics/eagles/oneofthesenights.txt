"One Of These Nights"

One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out
Pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling
The fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers
And moans

You got your demons
And you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Oh, someone to be kind to in
Between the dark and the light
Oh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams now
We're gonna find one
One that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little
Of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere
In sight

Oh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Oh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights

One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get ya baby one of these nights

One of these nights
One of these nights

I can feel it
I can feel it
One of these nights
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you now
One of these nights

And it gets so dark, so dark
In the cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you
Coming right behind you now
One of these nights
Ooh ooh

One of these nights
Ah and I wanna say ah!
One of these nights
Yes ah one of these one of these
One of these nights
Ah coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
One of these nights
