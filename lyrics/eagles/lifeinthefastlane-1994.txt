"Life In The Fast Lane (Live)"

He was a hard-headed man,
He was brutally handsome,
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up,
And he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city

He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red."

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane

Eager for action,
And hot for the game
The coming attraction,
The drop of a name

They knew all the right people,
They took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties,
They paid heavenly bills

There were lines on the mirror,
Lines on her face
She pretended not to notice,
She was caught up in the race

Out every evening,
Until it was light
He was too tired to make it,
She was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane,
Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane

Blowin' and burnin',
Blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign,
Took a turn for the worst

She said, "Listen, baby. You can hear the engine ring.
We've been up and down this highway; haven't seen a goddamn thing."

He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
"And the doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay him cash."

They went rushin' down that freeway,
Messed around and got lost
They didn't knew they were just dyin' to get off and it was...

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane,
Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane,

Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane
