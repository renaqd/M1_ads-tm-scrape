"You Belong To The City"

The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up

And the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat

The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces, its just like a dream

Nobody know where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city

Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood, its in your moves
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye

You were on the run
Tryin' to get away from all the things you'd done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd

'Cause you belong to the city...

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
'Cause you can take it

You belong to the city
