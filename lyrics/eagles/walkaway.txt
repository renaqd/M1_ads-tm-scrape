"Walk Away"

Takin' my time choosin' my line
Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop I don't wanna get off
I got myself hung up on you
Seems to me you don't want to talk about it
Seemed to me you just turn your pretty head and walk away

Places I've known things that I'm growin' and
Don't taste the same without you
Got myself in worst mess I've been
And I find myself startin' to doubt you
Comes a day talk all night here comes the morning
Come one night you just holdin' what we said and greet the day

I've got to cool myself down from stompin' around
Thinkin' some words 'cause I can't name ya
Guess it's okay got nothing to say
Still I don't suppose I can blame ya
Seems to me you don't wanna talk about it
Seemed to me you just turn your pretty head and walk away

Yeah walk away, walk away, walk away
