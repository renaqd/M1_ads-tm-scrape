"Pretty Maids All In A Row (Live)"

Hi there. How are 'ya?
Been a long time
Seems like we've come a long way
And my, but we learn so slow
And heroes, they come and they go
And leave us behind
As if we're supposed to know why

Oh, tell me why

Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?

And all you wishing-well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend,
Nice to hear from you again

And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember places to go
Pretty maids all in a row

All in a row
All in a row
