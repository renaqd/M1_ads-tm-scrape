"Earlybird"

Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away

He spends his days denying
That he's got no time for flying
In the breeze

High up on his own,
The eagle flies alone
And he is free

Earlybird is scratching
Though the going's getting tough
Time is passing by him
And he just can't get enough

He'll tell you all is going well
But he knows that somethings wrong
The earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone

Know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing
Crazy music just for fun

You know it makes feel so fine
And sets my mind at ease
To know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please

Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away

Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away

Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away
